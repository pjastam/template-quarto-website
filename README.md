<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository provides a template for building a Quarto website and
deploying it to Netlify with GitHub Actions. The instructions for using
this template are described
[here](https://www.pietstam.nl/posts/2023-05-29-deploy-site-to-netlify-with-github-actions/#a-versatile-template).
These instructions are part of [my blog
post](https://www.pietstam.nl/posts/2023-05-29-deploy-site-to-netlify-with-github-actions/)
about creating this template and a how-to guide to do that yourself.
